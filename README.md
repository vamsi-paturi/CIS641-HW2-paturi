### Technical Background
 - I completed my bachelor's degree in Food processing technology. After working as a food analyst for six months, I quit my job and began preparing for an IT job. I was hired as a web developer by a small startup in Hyderabad, where I used to only handle the content addition part rather than direct coding. I left the job after about nine months and began preparing for my master's after which I landed up here at GVSU.
